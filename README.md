#Predator IIFE



## Description
In this exercise I combined my knowledge of iife's, augmented iife's, xhr and callback functions to create a simple website that pulls from two json files using xhr and prints them to the dom using an augmented iife and a callback function.

## How to run
In your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser.
